# Two-Gi-Oh
This is Two-Gi-Oh, a simplified version of the popular card game Yu-Gi-Oh.
The game is played between you and a friend.
## How to play
The game is split up into 2 phases per turn.

In the Main phase, players can place monsters and set spells and trap.
Note that only 1 monster can be summoned in a given turn but any number of spells and traps can be played given enough space.
The Board has 3 monster zones and 3 spell/traps zones per player.

In the Battle phase, players can command their monsters to attack other monsters and even the other player, with the intention of trying to reduce their life points to zero

Each player starts with 5 cards, but the first player cannot attack on their first turn and players draw a card at the beginning of each round after the first.

Each player starts with 4000 life points and 20 cards.

Monsters have 3 stats, Attack points, Defense Points, and Level.

If a monster is in attack position, they can attack and use their attack points for battle

If a monster is in defense position, they cannot attack and use their defense points for battle

A monster is destroyed if their attack is greater than or equal to their targets attack or dense points

Monsters can only changed position after the turn they are summoned, but they can be summoned in any position

If a monster is level 2, then you must tribute another monster to summon it.

## How to actually play

When you summon a monster, activate a spell or set a trap; click on the card in your hand, then click on a corresponding zone.

When a spell card has a target, click on that target after it is placed.

Click on the B symbol to move onto the battle phase.

To attack, click on your monster.

Your opponent will get the opportunity to activate a trap when you do.

If they do not activate a trap, you would either deal direct damage if there are no monsters on your opponent's field.
But if they do, you would then click on a monster to battle.

To end your turn, click on the E symbol.
